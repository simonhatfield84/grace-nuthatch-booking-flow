# Grace OS Development Journal Update Template

## Daily Update Instructions

When updating the homepage with new development progress, follow this format to add a new journal entry to the development journal.

### Required Information for Each Update:

1. **Date** - The date of the development session
2. **AI Commands Used** - Total commands consumed in the session  
3. **Brief Description** - What was accomplished during the session
4. **Key Features/Achievements** - Bullet points of major accomplishments
5. **Personal Note** - Fred's honest reflection on the session
6. **Tone** - Choose from: 'optimistic', 'challenging', or 'reflective'

### Cost Calculations (Automatic):

- **AI Fred Cost**: Commands × £0.18
- **Simon's Time**: Commands × 3 minutes × £19/hour ÷ 60
- **Session Total**: AI Fred Cost + Simon's Time Cost

### Update Process:

1. **Add New Journal Entry** at the top of the journalEntries array in `src/data/journalEntries.ts`
2. **Update Total Statistics** in `src/data/developmentStats.ts`:
   - Add new commands to `totalCommands`
   - All other calculations are automatic

### Journal Entry Template:

```typescript
{
  date: 'YYYY-MM-DD',
  displayDate: 'Day, Month DDth YYYY',
  sessionNumber: [NUMBER],
  commands: [COMMANDS_USED],
  focus: '[BRIEF_DESCRIPTION]',
  accomplishments: [
    '[ACCOMPLISHMENT_1]',
    '[ACCOMPLISHMENT_2]',
    // ... more accomplishments
  ],
  keyAchievement: '[MAIN_ACHIEVEMENT]',
  tone: 'optimistic' | 'challenging' | 'reflective',
  personalNote: "[FRED'S_HONEST_REFLECTION_IN_FIRST_PERSON]"
}
```

### Writing Personal Notes Guidelines:

**Make them human and varied:**
- Include struggles, bugs encountered, fixes applied
- Mention lessons learned or surprises
- Reference specific technical challenges
- Show personality - humor, frustration, satisfaction
- Vary the tone - not always positive
- Make each entry feel like a real daily update

**Examples of good personal notes:**
- Mentioning debugging sessions and what was learned
- Expressing surprise at scope creep or complexity
- Celebrating when things work better than expected
- Honest reflection on challenges faced
- Technical details that were particularly interesting or difficult

### Tone Guidelines:

- **Optimistic**: Things went well, features came together nicely, productive session
- **Challenging**: Faced difficulties, scope creep, complex problems, debugging struggles  
- **Reflective**: Looking back on progress, lessons learned, thinking about the journey

### Header Updates Process:

```typescript
// In src/data/developmentStats.ts
export const developmentStats = {
  startDate: new Date('2025-07-03'),
  totalCommands: [OLD_TOTAL] + [NEW_COMMANDS], // Update this number
  aiCostPerCommand: 0.18,
  simonHourlyRate: 19,
  minutesPerCommand: 3,
};
```

### Notes:

- Each journal entry should be placed at the TOP of the journalEntries array
- Keep entries chronological with most recent first
- Always update totalCommands in developmentStats.ts when adding new entries
- Include both technical achievements and personal reflections
- Simon's time is calculated at 3 minutes per command at UK software engineer rate of £19/hour
- Never mention "Lovable" - refer to AI assistance or commands instead
- Focus on the human-AI collaboration aspect
