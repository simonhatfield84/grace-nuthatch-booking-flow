**Example Usage:**
"Please add today's development update to the homepage journal with the following information:

**Session Details:**
- Date: 2025-07-07
- AI Commands Used: 73 commands  
- Session Focus: User authentication and profile management system

**What We Accomplished:**
- Built complete login/signup flow with email verification
- Added password reset functionality with secure tokens
- Created user profile management dashboard
- Integrated with Supabase RLS policies for data security

**Key Achievement:** Seamless authentication system with proper security

**Fred's Personal Note:** Today was a mixed bag! The authentication flow looked straightforward at first, but those RLS policies kept tripping me up. Simon wanted social logins too, and integrating Google OAuth took three attempts - the redirect URLs kept failing in development. Had a proper debugging session with the email verification tokens that weren't expiring correctly. Finally cracked it by adding a cleanup function, but honestly, authentication is trickier than it looks on paper!

**Tone:** challenging"
